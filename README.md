# EVCDgen - Electric Vehicle Charging Demand generator
This page hosts the tool used for generating EV charging demand patterns based on Dutch mobility data. This is a basic tool with the purpose of generating EV charging demand patterns out of regular mobility data. The tool converts anonymized single-day trip diaries of Dutch citizens to weekly EV mobility schedules and connects these schedules to a model that decides when and at what location type (home, work, public) starts to charge based on its State-of-Charge.

More information can be found in the related research paper, which is going to be presented in the CIRED22 Workshop, 2-3 June 2022 [1].

## How to use:
The file uses input data from the Dutch Mobility study ODiN 2019 [2]. We cannot redistribute this data directly so you should get your own license via https://doi.org/10.17026/dans-xpv-mwpg.

(1) Get access to the ODiN data and place the datafile in ./data

(2) Run prepareData.py to generate the necessary inputs for the schedule generator

(3) Run chargingProbability.py to generate charging probability curves

(4) Run main.py
